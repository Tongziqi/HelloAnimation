# HelloAnimation VisionOS Demo

`HelloAnimation` is a demonstration of animation in SwiftUI designed for VisionOS, showcasing how to use custom animations and color gradients. This project demonstrates creating complex linear gradients for various commodity colors (gold, silver, platinum, and bronze) and applying these gradients within an animated path.
Here how it looks.

Ideally you should ask your designer to create SVG file with single continuous bezier curve, export it and convert it with online converter [like this one](http://svg-converter.kyome.io/) or manually.
You can find "Hello" example [here](Files/Hello.swift).

## Features

- Built with Swift and SwiftUI.
- Supports multiple commodity color gradients: Gold, Silver, Platinum, and Bronze.
- Custom `Shape` for animated path.
- Implements `LinearGradient` for rich color gradient effects.
- Infinite loop animation effect, elegantly displaying animation capabilities.
